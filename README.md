# Compact OmegaT Glossary Layout 

This is an alternative glossary layout for OmegaT created using 
[glossary-renderer-plugin-skeleton](https://github.com/omegat-org/glossary-renderer-plugin-skeleton) by Hiroshi Miura. 


## Building

To build the plugin, run `./gradlew installDist` (Kotlin DSL is used)

## Dependencies

OmegaT and dependencies are located on remote maven repositories.
It is necessary to connect the internet to compile your project.

This plugin uses OmegaT 5.7.0.

## Where is a built artifact?

You can find distribution files in `build/distributions/*.zip`.
Also you can find jar files at `build/libs/`


## Installation

You can get a plugin jar file from zip distribution file.
OmegaT plugin should be placed in `plugins` subfolder of your OmegaT user config folder (menu **Options** â†’ **Access Configuration Folder** in OmegaT, create `plugins` subfolder if it's not there).
OmegaT searches for plugins in that folder recursively, so if you have more than one plugin, you may create a subfolder for each of them to contain the plugin's files. It might be convenient, but it's not necessary.
